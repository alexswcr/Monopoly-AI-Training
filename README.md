# Monopoly-AI-Training
This Colab notebook contains all of the files to:
- Create a simulated Monopoly evironment (fully functional)
- Create random neural network agents
- Train neural network agents over 1000s of games

An additional notebook to let humans test out the environment is also included (Human Simulated Tycoon)

Each simulated monopoly game is able to be completed in ~3 seconds if all players are AI bots, meaning thousands of games can be played in a few hours. This was used to train the models shown in our group's Property Tycoon game (identical to Monopoly except some stylistic difference). For the development of that software, my role was Project Manager, in addition to the sole developer of the AI agent. This was submitted as part of the coursework for Software Engineering (Year 2 Semester 2).

## How to Run
There are two Colab Notebooks which are nearly identical. Simulated Tycoon contains all of the code to simulate the environment and train neural network agents, while Human Simulated Tycoon omits the agents and adds a console interface to play monopoly with humans. To run either notebook, simply run each code block sequentially. Each code block has comments that explain what each part does and how it works.
