        "2.   Playing 75 games of monopoly with these agents, counting how many time each agent wins\n",

        "\n",
        "**Secondly,** the mutation function. Due to the already relatively large size of the networks, I opted for a very simple mutation, the creep mutation. This adds a gaussian noise (mean at 0, SD based on mutation rate) to each layer of the network, if the agent does not win.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Thirdly,** the fitness function. As monopoly is still immensely based on chance, to give a reliable fitness function, it must first simulate a large quantity of games. This fitness function simply counts how many times each agent wins, the agent with the most wins is deemd the winner of that generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Finally,** the crossover function. Once again, as each agent is quite big, the crossover function is very simple. Typically, a crossover function would look at each individual parameter, decide a crossover point, and then merge the two genotypes together. However in this case, the crossover function looks at each gene in the genotype (layer weights) and gives it a chance to be replaced with the winners weights."
